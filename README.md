# Text Compression Algorithms

This repository implements various text compression algorithms, including **Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT)**, **Run-Length Encoding (RLE)**, and **Huffman Coding**. These techniques are widely used in data compression and provide a foundation for understanding more advanced compression methods.

## Features

1. **Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT):**
   - Transforms a string into a format that is more amenable to compression.
   - Includes both the transform and inverse transform functions.

2. **Run-Length Encoding (RLE):**
   - Compresses a string by replacing consecutive repeated characters with a single character and a count.

3. **Huffman Coding:**
   - Builds a Huffman tree based on character frequencies and generates optimal prefix codes for compression.
   - Includes encoding and decoding functions.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/pskh2004/Text-Compression-Algorithms.git
   cd Text-Compression-Algorithms
